## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ yarn add preact-glam
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import glam from 'preact-glam'

// using CommonJS modules
var glam = require('preact-glam')
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/preact-glam/dist/preact-glam.umd.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.preactGlam`.

## Usage

Please refer to [glamorous-tiny](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous#size).

It should support all the features supported by `glamorous-tiny` (with the exception of theming support).

## Tests

```sh
$ yarn run test
```
